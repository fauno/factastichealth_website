## I have definitely&nbsp;one and it really helps me a lot also in dealing with stress and fatigue.

The night is mostly for preparation and doing things offline as much as I can. Trying to avoid&nbsp;[blue light](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/q-a-why-is-blue-light-before-bedtime-bad-for-sleep/). Prepare the food and smoothies for the next day.

Also the evening meditation&nbsp;before going to bed. That also really helps me;I think due to leaving less for the brain to process while sleeping & dreaming.

Mapping my top 3 priorities for the next day helps me to focus on them easier and get things done.

Some brainstorming and thinking about my numero uno goal or problem that I try to solve before going to bed, primes up my mind.

The most important rule is to go to bed at least 7 (or better 8) hours before the intended wake up time. &nbsp; &nbsp;
