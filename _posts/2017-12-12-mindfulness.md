Mindfulness  is an intentional cultivation of consciousness, which is believed to promote [well-being](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2003-02410-012). Mindfulness practice in daily life with focused attention, awareness, and non-judgemental, accepting attitude demonstrates [benefits in health](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1989-97542-000), productivity, overcoming addictions, avoiding burnout, self-regulating behaviour and positive emotional states.

I used to think I was too busy to spend time on mindfulness and besides, there was no sufficient evidence to relate the effects in physical health. Little did I know that my approach was purely judgemental and unaccepting, building limits to a better version of my health and well-being. After some research, I decided to squeeze mindfulness practices into my busy daily schedule even only for 1 minute every day. Realisations came after each other: it was noisy, chaotic, painful and restless, everything contrary to what I expected in exchange of my spent time. Just like I observed my breath, I observed my mind trying to get me out of the practice. The value of regular practice has given me one of the greatest gifts of understanding that I have a choice; all movements inside my mind will just pass if I let them go without attachment. Without any resistance or distraction, I could breathe calmly and be mindful of my body and state of my mind by practicing consistently. I could observe myself getting better in focusing, stress relief and ultimately having increased performance in my daily life.
