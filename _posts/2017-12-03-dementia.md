[Dementia](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs362/en/) is the name for a group of symptoms, which include impairments in cognitive functions (thought, communication, memory, thinking, orientation, calculation, learning capacity, language, and judgement) where consciousness is not affected. Worldwide, around 47 million people have dementia and it is [projected to nearly triple by 2050](https://www.dementiastatistics.org/statistics/global-prevalence/).

Researchers have come up with a new test, which may help diagnose and identify&nbsp;those who are already at high risk. Since the initial sites of Alzheimer's disease&nbsp;pathology appears to be associated with an asymmetrical (left greater than right) decrement of odour detection sensitivity (olfactory dysfunction),&nbsp; a quick "[Peanut Butter](http://www.jns-journal.com/article/S0022-510X(13)00311-0/pdf)" or "[Sniffin'Sticks](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170929093251.htm)" may be a useful tool for predicting the onset of the disease.

As the diet and lifestyle changes could potentially [prevent](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alzheimers-disease/) millions of cases a year, [Alzheimer's disease is incurable but preventable](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20182017).

Below are the ideal health behaviours that will help maintain our quality of life and cognitive functions, besides reduce the risk of dementia:

- [Regular exercise](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29149797)

- [Functional foods](http://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/6/4/81/htm)
- [Dietary supplements](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29171642) (Omega-3 fatty acids, Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA))
- Preventing the [Aluminum and Lead Exposure](https://www.aerzteblatt.de/int/archive/article?id=193516)&nbsp;(processed foods, [cheese](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18436363), cooking utensils and baking trays, food packaging, cosmetic products (including antiperspirants, sun creams, toothpaste), drugs (antacid agents))
