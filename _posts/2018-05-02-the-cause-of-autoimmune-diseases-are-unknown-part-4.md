## Here are some of the bad boys that cause inflammation.

While any protein food "parts" can leak into the bloodstream and cause inflammation&nbsp;in the joints, there are some foods you should definitely avoid while beginning your gut repair.

[Red meat](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/role-of-meat-in-the-expression-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/1592E7763094E9EB6AF0FCA2A9B807ED) should be avoided and especially pork meat.

Chicken protein and eggs.

Wheat protein from&nbsp;wheat cereals, pizza,&nbsp;pasta, bread,...

Soy products like&nbsp;tempeh, soy-meat, tofu and so on...

Milk proteins from dairy products like&nbsp;yogurt,&nbsp;ice cream, cheese,&nbsp;chocolate,...

Avoid all fats from animal products (highly saturated) and oils (olive oil, palm oil, etc.) except&nbsp;Omega 3 from plant sources like algae.

Sometimes also nightshade vegetables like&nbsp;potatoes (sweet potato is not a nightshade&nbsp;and causes no inflammation), tomatoes, eggplants, peppers,...

After a few months of gut healing, the&nbsp;nightshade vegetables can be introduced one sort at a time.

And what are foods to begin with for our gut healing? We will discuss that in [part 5](https://factastichealth.com/the-cause-of-autoimmune-diseases-are-unknown-part-5) of this series. &nbsp;
