The [Temporomandibular joint (TMJ)](https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/health-info/tmj) connects the lower jaw bone (the mandible) to the bone at the side of the skull on each side of the head with muscles controlling movements in three(up&down, forward&back, side to side) directions for coordination of actions such as talking, chewing, swallowing, and yawning. 
Temporomandibular Joint syndrome (TMJ), also known as TMD (TM-Disorder), causes symptoms such as jaw pain, limited ability to open the mouth, headaches, neck.

Temporomandibular Disorders (TMD) are a complex and poorly understood set of conditions characterized by pain in the jaw joint and surrounding tissues and limitation in jaw movements
