## How is it possible that our gut gets into stress?

Our gut can be under stress from infections or a loss of ecological balance for example as a side effect of using antibiotics. Our body will try to restore the balance by decreasing [tryptophan](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5292609/). Tryptophan is also a precursor to [serotonin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4728667/) a neurotransmitter that makes us "feel good". Tryptophan is ingested as food by some bacteria in our gut.

In order our body can restore its gut balance it activates the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and degrades serotonin and tryptophan. So no more food for bacteria that uses them. This can potentially cause depression and anxiety in us, degrade our memory - brain fog, disturbances in cognition, appetite, sleep and body temperature disturbances like cold extremities or fevers.

Psychological and emotional stress can also trigger inflammation in our gut and brain. That's why mind-body exercises for managing stress are fundamental if we want to to get rid of inflammation and heal our gut. Without this, the healing won't last or wouldn't even take place in the first place. If you have a high-stress life or dealing with past/present traumas you should take extra care of your gut.
